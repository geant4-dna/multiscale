SUMMARY
This example shows the simulation of cells in a periodic domain with a
source uniformly distributed throughout the simulation domain. This
provides a means of simulating the impact of secondary electrons
created in water upon cells. The periodic domain and source
configuration eliminate any spatial bias from the simulation.

0- MACRO PARTICULARITIES
    When defining the macro file for this simulation, the order in which
    the geometry and physics is defined is important, due to the
    dependance of the the periodic boundary condition upon the periodic
    domain defined in the parallel world. As such, these commands need to
    be ordered in the following way

    /micro/det/setSize     # will set the size of the periodic domain
    /micro/det/setMargin   # parameter that controls secondary production
    /micro/phys/addPhysics # physics list is dependant upon the setSize
    /run/initialize        # build physics and detector
    /gps/...               # Any GPS commands after initialisation

    This behaviour means that while the geometry can be updated by
    calling /micro/det/update, this will not change the geometry of
    the periodic region, which is tied to the physics list and hence the
    initialision step.


1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
    The geometry in this simulation is a small box with a periodic boundary
    condition. That is, particles that leave the box on the -z side will re-
    enter on the +z side. The size of the simulation domain should be
    slightly larger than the largest path traversable by a particle
    simulated. For 100 keV electrons, for example, a 200um size box is
    appropriate.

    Cells are placed randomly in this domain as the sensitive detectors. The
    simulation detects when a cell is hit, and records its point and direction
    of entry, as well as the energy deposits made within the cell - their
    locations and magnitude.

5- SUMMARY OF MACRO COMMANDS

    /micro/det
        /micro/det/setSize double unit
            Set size of the simulation domain. The size is the side length
            of the square that defines the simulation area
        /micro/det/setMargin double unit
            Set the "safety margin" parameter that controls the two volumes
            just inside and outside the periodic region. These volumes act to
            reduce energy loss from the periodic domain caused by secondaries
            that do not experience the periodic boundary process. The parameter
            should be greater than 0.001 nm, typical values are on the order of
            1nm
        /micro/det/update
            Re-initialise the geometry. Will not change the periodic boundary
            size.

    /micro/cell
        /micro/cell/setShape string
            Set the shape of the solid that will make up each cell. Options
            are:
                "ellipse"
                "sphere"
        /micro/cell/setSizeHalfX  double unit
        /micro/cell/setSizeHalfY  double unit
        /micro/cell/setSizeHalfZ  double unit
        /micro/cell/setSizeRadius double unit
            Use these commands to set the half lengths of the cell geometry,
            or alternatively the radius

    /micro/test
        /micro/test/useTestMode
            Run a "test mode" of the simulation. Rather than placing cells,
            the sensitive detector becomes the periodic region. This permits
            a user to know how much energy is `leaking' from the periodic
            domain.

    /micro/phys
        /micro/phys/addPhysics string
            Specify the physics list to use. Choices are:
                EmDNAPhysics
                EmDNAPhysics_option1
                EmLivermorePhysics
                EmPenelopePhysics
                EmStandardPhysics
                EmStandardPhysics_option[1-4]
        /micro/phys/minEnergy double unit
            Specify a minimum energy cut for the physics list, where the
            physics list permits it.

    /micro/gun
        /micro/gun/useRandPos
            Direct the simulation to position the particle source at a new
            random position inside the periodic box for each new event/
        /micro/gun/useRandDir
            Direct the simulation to fire particles in a random direction
            from each point.
        /micro/gun/setPos threevector unit
            Specify a dimensioned three vector which will be used as the
            particle source location.
        /micro/gun/setDir threevector
            Specify a vector along which to fire particles.
